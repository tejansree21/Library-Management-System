# Library Management System (SQL Project)

## Project Overview
The **Library Management System** is a database project built using **SQL** that helps manage books, authors, library members, and borrow/return transactions efficiently.  
It simulates the operations of a real-world library â€” tracking books, due dates, fines, and stock availability.

This project demonstrates **data relationships, constraints, joins, and reporting queries** commonly used in relational database management.

  - Primary and Foreign Keys  
  - Table Relationships (1-M, M-M)  
  - Aggregations & Group By  
  - Date Functions (`CURDATE()`, `DATEDIFF()`)  
  - Joins & Data Constraints
